I developed a the classic Tetris game using C++ programming language with **Object Oriented Programming** principles in mind. In order to render the game, I utilized the **raylib** library. To make it accessible to a anybody, I deployed the game online on itch.io. Now anyone can enjoy playing this fun and challenging game without the need for additional downloads or installations.
